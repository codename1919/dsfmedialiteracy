        <p class="information">Fake news is false information or propaganda published under the guise of being authentic. It has become very prevalent in our society because news networks often post information faster than they can fact check it. Next, people tend to be part of online echo chambers, and spread information through social media without fact checking it before sharing it. Finally, some people make a living off fake news. They write articles about fake events or facts and make money off of ads.

<p class="information">First off, there is a lot of money to be made in fake news. Some people make a living off making fake news. They do this by writing articles that drive up site traffic, which increases ad profit. Next, many people following accounts on social media that post or spread information or articles that resemble the person's opinions. These are called echo chambers. What happens next is the person then is less likely to accept new or contrary information that contradict their opinion. This is called group polarization and confirmation bias. The person ends up with a more extreme version of what they thought and then contribute to the growing fake news problem. This is why it is so important to be educated on fake news. The public is wary of mainstream journalism today; however, big publications that run websites and print circulation to distribute the news usually have the best reporters. This means the reporters are skilled, college educated, and are bound by a code ethics.  </p>

      <h2>
  Why people make and spread fake news:</h2>
      <p3> 
        <ul>
          <li>To play off the gullibility of people in order to make money or spread propaganda</li>
          <li>They read an article on social media and share before reading it or fact checking it </li>
          <li>They do not carefully consider information and spread it with almost no thought</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="information">Before you like, retweet, or repost an article make sure you read it and fact check it first. The majority of social media uses donâ€™t read all of the articles that they post or retweet. 
Next, always make sure the website is reliable. If there obtrusive ads, popups, and flashing banners, odds are the site is garbage. In addition, some fake news websites like to resemble real websites in layout or in url. The abc example is an excellent representation of this. 
Finally, if there is a sponsored tag, always fact check the article because it is biased and unreliable.  </p>

      <h2>
      How to identify fake news:
      </h2>
      <p4>
        <ul>
          <li>Check the facts, are they confirmed from other sources? Do they make sense? </li>
          <li>Is there an author?
            <ul>
              <li>Who is the author?</li>
              <li>Is the author qualified to write?
                <ul>
                  <li>Can you research them?</li>
                  <li>Do they have a degree?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Is the authors first and last name available?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Look at the citations and date of the article </li>
          <li>An excellent resource to use in order to fact check information is <a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="information">Double check the facts in the articles. Do they make logical sense, is it confirmed by other websites, are the sources cited? Check links to sources, if they are broken or are fake, be wary of potential fake news. 
Does the article have an author, a date published? How old is the article?
Also snopes is a good resource to use in order to check the validity of information. </p>
